# Homebrew/linux-dev

This Tap used to house tools for Homebrew developers on Linux. These tools were mostly used during the linuxbrew-core to homebrew-core migration. Some commands became useless after the migration, and the rest of the useful things have been integrated in Homebrew/brew or Homebrew/homebrew-core since then.
